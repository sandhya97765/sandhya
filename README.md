# CI/CD PipeLine

## Description
This project is a simple web application built with Flask. It includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for testing and deployment.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project

### 5. Report Explaining CI/CD Process, Tool Choices, and Scaling

In the report, you should:
- Describe the GitHub Actions workflow and how it automates testing and deployment.
- Explain the choice of tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Flask, Heroku).
- Discuss potential improvements or scaling considerations for larger applications.

You can format the report as a separate `REPORT.md` file, or include it in the `README.md` file.

### Next Steps

Once you have completed these tasks, submit the deliverables as required. You can provide a link to your GitHub repository and any other necessary details. Let me know if you need further guidance.
